The objective of this application is to educate a guitar player the multiple varieties he or she can play a scale. The scales currently presented by this application are the seven modes. For those who do not know, the modes are the following:

Ionian (I) [Major]

Dorian (II)

Phrygian (III)

Lydian (IV)

Mixolydian (V)

Aeolian (VI) [Minor]

Locrian (VII)

The selections a user will need to choose is a scale, the starting root, and the end root (for instance, the 3rd fret of the E string, and the 5th fret of the D string, which are both G notes). The fretboard will appropriately light up each root for easy identification.
